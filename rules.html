        <div class="rules-content">
            <p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid.</p>
            <h2>Objective:</h2>
            <p>Be the first player to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
            <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The game is played by two players. One player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'.</li>
                <li>Players take turns placing their mark in an empty cell on the grid.</li>
                <li>The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins.</li>
                <li>If all cells are filled and no player has achieved three in a row, the game is a draw.</li>
